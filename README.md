# 8bit-shapes

Files can be run as is in processing, creating a composition using a quantum simulator with Micro Qiskit.
To create a composition with data from a real quantum computer, change the boolean "simulate" to "false"
and place a .txt file in the root folder. The name of that .txt file should match the "dataSource" variable. 
The .txt file should be an array of 8 bit strings. eg. ['10111110', '01000001', '00100100']
